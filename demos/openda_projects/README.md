# OpenDA projects

If new to OpenDA, it seems advisable to work through the available
OpenDA projects in the following order:

* [DUD](DUD) (How to calibrate model paramters?)
* [SeqSim](SeqSim) (How to perform a single simulation run in successive steps?)
* [SeqEnsSim](SeqEnsSim) (How to perform  multiple interleaved simulation runs?)
* [EnKF](EnKF) (How to use data assimilation to improve model states?)

Note that all examples are thought to explaing the basic configuration of the
OpenDa-HydPy wrapper and to check that it is working correctly (at least for
the four used algorithms).  Hence, all example are very simple and do not
serve well to evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of the the applied
HydPy models and OpenDA algorithms.
