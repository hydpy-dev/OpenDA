# OpenDA projects

If new to [OpenDA](http://openda.org/) or 
[HydPy](https://github.com/hydpy-dev/hydpy), it seems advisable to work 
through the available OpenDA projects in the following order:

* [DUD](DUD) (How to calibrate model parameters?)
* [SeqSim](SeqSim) (How to perform a single simulation run in successive steps?)
* [SeqEnsSim](SeqEnsSim) (How to perform  multiple interleaved simulation runs?)
* [EnKF](EnKF) (How to use data assimilation to improve model states?)
