# Examples

Use the following examples for a quick start on coupling OpenDA and HydPy.  
There are four [OpenDa demo projects](openda_projects), each one relying on
a different algorithm.  We apply each algorithm either to the "Dill" or 
the "Lahn 1" headwater catchment of the 
[HydPy demo project "LahnH"][hydpy_projects/LahnH).

Note that all examples are thought to explain the basic configuration 
of the [HydPyOpenDABBModelWrapper](../extensions/HydPyOpenDABBModelWrapper) 
and to check that it is working correctly (at least for the four used 
algorithms).  Hence, all examples are most simple and do not serve well 
to evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of the applied 
[HydPy](https://github.com/hydpy-dev/hydpy) models and 
[OpenDA](http://openda.org/) algorithms.
