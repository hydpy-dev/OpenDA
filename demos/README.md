# Examples

Use the following examples for a quick start on coupling OpenDA and HydPy.  
There are four [OpenDa demo projects](openda_projects), each one using a 
different algorithm.  All [OpenDa demo projects](openda_projects) rely
on the same [HydPy project](hydpy_projects), meaning the different algorithms
are applied on the same watershed.
