# Optimising HydPy models with OpenDA

This repository provides a [wrapper](extensions/HydPyOpenDABBModelWrapper/README.md), allowing to optimise hydrological models implemented into the HydPy framework using numerical algorithms implemented into the Open Data Assimilation framework.  See the [demo projects](demos/README.md) for some working examples.
